# Standalone Python Scripts
## Overview
These scripts are standalone scripts that are able to be run on any Raspberry Pi with the correct packages installed. <TODO>Add the required modules/packages when installing</TODO>. For now, our Raspberry Pi 3 with Raspian has everything installed. If you get any errors, let me know.

## Running
Copy these files, open a virtual environment, and execute the file using:

```python  getTempOnButtonPress.py```

To exit the program, for now just press the below keys when in the console:

```ctrl+c```

## Schematics and Files
Schematics and Fritzing files are available for each program. Please ensure you wire up everything correctly before turning on/connecting the Raspberry Pi. Double check everything before turning it on, as you could potentially break the Raspberry Pi and/or sensor if connected incorrectly.

Each program has the associated png schematic file associated to it.

### Fritzing
Each program also has the Fritzing files if you want to update/alter/create a new schematic.
